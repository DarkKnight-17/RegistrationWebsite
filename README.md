This is the implementation of registration/login system via node.js and postgreSQL as the database.
For an applicaiton to work properly, a user should have node.js and postgreSQl installed on their computer.
Moreover, there is ".env" file where environment variables regarding the database details of the user on PGAdmin are written.
You need to change those variables so that they match your local database(i.e. database owner, password, database name) 
Finally, make sure to install necessary dependencies from npm package manager specified in "package.json" file, otherwise the website will not operate properly
